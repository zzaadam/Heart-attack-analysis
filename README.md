# Heart Attack Risk Estimation Project

## Overview
This data science project aims to estimate the likelihood of an individual experiencing a heart attack based on various health-related factors. Logistic regression is used as the predictive model to assess the risk. The project leverages Python and data analysis techniques to process and analyze the data, build the model, and generate insights.

# Model Evaluation
The project includes metrics for model evaluation, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance in predicting heart attack risk.
